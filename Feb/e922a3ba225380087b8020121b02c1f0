By Jan Cronje SA mining employers body the Minerals Council says its members will check up on the status of their waste dams in light of the collapse of a mine dam in Brazil that caused 99 deaths with many more unaccounted for. The dam, which stores mine waste called tailings, collapsed at the Corrego de Feijao mine in Brumadinho last Friday. In a statement the council said all its members should “review their tailing storage facilities construction, maintenance and operating protocols, in order to ensure the stability and safety of these facilities and the surrounding communities. The council also sent its condolences to the people of Brazil and those affected by the collapse.
