Technology has been making inroads into the global mining sector, from automation to drone technology and other software and IT applications. Africa is no exception to this global trend. Technology has proven to improve efficiency and safety whilst reducing costs for mining companies but implementation is still patchy within Africa. MiningTech Africa seeks to address this gap by providing a dedicated event platform in Africa focused on connecting technology firms with miners and investors and welcomes all miners and technological firms interested in being a part of the African mining transformation to participate in this event from 7-8 March in Johannesburg, South Africa. There is vast untapped potential to harness technology in the African continent to benefit all stakeholders, ranging from large established mining companies to artisanal small-scale miners. Hence there is plenty of business opportunities here in Africa on the technology front. Diversity of speakers
At MiningTech Africa, experienced speakers from both the mining and technology sector will share their experiences with attendees. They include speakers from the following organisations:
• Afarak Group, South Africa
• Mmakau Mining, South Africa
• Village Main Reef Gold Mining Company, South Africa
• Blockchain Association, South Africa
• Fujairah Gold Vedanta Resources, Ghana
• Nordgold (SOMITA), Burkina Faso
• Broadway Gold Mining, Canada With a core of speakers based in Africa, insights will be drawn mainly from experiences in the African continent and will benefit global attendees who might be entering the African market for the first time. There will also be international speakers from countries such as Ghana, Canada and India who will present alternative perspectives based on lessons drawn from their own region, adding to a truly international exchange of ideas and learning experience at MiningTech Africa. Why Johannesburg, South Africa? South Africa is a mineral-rich country that consistently ranks among the top 5 mining countries in the
world. With a well-established mining sector which is one of the main contributors to the country’s
GDP, South Africa is the ideal location for MiningTech Africa. South Africa’s government has also been supportive towards technological advancement in mining, with the creation of the Mandela Mining Precinct in Johannesburg in 2018 to bring together government, private companies and universities for this cause. Johannesburg is also home to Africa’s largest stock exchange so both the technological and financial institutions make Johannesburg the obvious destination to host MiningTech Africa. Spaces are still available for sponsors, exhibitors and delegates who wish to be a part of MiningTech
Africa. Delegates can enjoy discounts of up to $400 with the early bird pricing. Enquiries can be sent
