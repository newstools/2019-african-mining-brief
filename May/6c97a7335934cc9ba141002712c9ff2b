Webber Wentzel The Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) has developed a ‘National Screening Tool‘ which is a geographically based web-enabled system that houses a wealth of environmental data obtained from a number of public and private organisations over the last few years. The purpose of this tool is to enable an applicant who intends to submit an application for an environmental authorisation (EA) under the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998 (NEMA) to pre-screen the proposed site for environmental sensitivity, among other things. We are informed that the use of the Screening Tool will become mandatory in the coming months – the date is yet to be announced. When this happens, the requirement under Regulation 16(1)(v) of the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, 2014 (EIA Regulations, 2014) for a site-specific report which is generated by the Screening Tool to be submitted with all EA applications under NEMA (Regulation 16 Report) will be brought into force. On Friday last week, the Minister
of Environmental Affairs published her intention to prescribe additional
procedures for assessment and reporting that will be required to be followed
when applying for an EA, and which will also involve the use of the Screening
Tool (Notice): In Webber Wentzel’s view, the
Screening Tool, together with the developments proposed in terms of the Notice,
have the potential to greatly improve the quality of specialist studies that
are prepared in an EIA process. Comments on the Notice are due by 10 June 2019.
