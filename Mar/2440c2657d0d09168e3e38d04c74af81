By Shingie Lev Muringi Government has through
the enactment of the Companies and Business Entities Bill scrapped the
indigenous policy, deemed unfavorable to foreign investors who are now able to
set up operations without adhering to the 51-49 percent shareholding. Through the new
Companies and Business Entities Bill, foreign companies can now issued with a
Certificate of Incorporation without surrendering 51% of their shareholding to
locals. Commenting on the new
Companies Bill, renowned business expert Busisa Moyo said the new policy was a
welcome move which effectively kills the previous unattractive Indigenization
instrument and enable foreign entities to setup businesses in Zimbabwe with
great ease. “But in my humble
view, the old Indigenization policy must be removed on the diamond and platinum
sector as well. We can fix tax strangers but welcome them to open up
businesses, bring technology and skills” added Busisa Moyo. Clause 228 of Chapter
III of the New Companies and Business Entities Bill says that every foreign
company intending to establish a  business in Zimbabwe must lodge with the
Minister a copy of its constitutive documents, a list of directors resident or
to be resident in Zimbabwe and if it is a subsidiary, the name of its holdings
company. However business mogul,
Mutumwa Mawere had a different view of the new Companies and Business Entities
Bill saying there are several irregularities in the proposed amendment. “A company must be treated as a company. Should an apartheid system be created that provides for the creation of foreign and local companies, this will produce several inequalities where companies with foreign holdings are being given high value over those with local shareholders” said Mawere.
