In an effort to use its proximity to diamond-rich Botswana, the Namibian government has begun talks with Botswana as it seeks “to become a centre of diamond polishing”, according to a report quoted by Rough & Polished. In an interview with the Windhoek Observer, Namibia’s mines and energy minister Tom Alweendo said: “With Botswana doing the selling of diamonds, maybe Namibia can become the hub for diamond polishing and manufacturing. “We are actually talking to Botswana for Namibia to become the centre for diamond polishing. We are working on that. Of course when that happens, the benefit you get is not so much from government taxes, but employment creation”. Currently, rough diamonds from De Beers’ operations in Canada, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa are sent to Botswana’s capital, Gaborone. While Namibia is the world’s largest producer of marine diamonds, it has suffered high unemployment “as mines close and the construction sector falters”, according to the piece.
